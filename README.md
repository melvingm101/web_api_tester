# Web API Tester

This project is a sample Web API tester project. It contains the test website and the files to test Web API security. We would need Python installed to run these files, which we can do here: [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Setup

`scanner_files` folder contains bash scripts which can be executed. We need to make sure that these packages are installed first.

- `whatweb`: Responsible for analyzing web request and providing some basic info about the technologies used. 

## Web server setup

For testing, we can use Metasploitable3 or the OWASP Juice Shop, which can be installed here [OWASP Juice Setup](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)
